This is my [personal portfolio website](http://portfolio-2-0.cfsanderson.surge.sh/)
). ![](http://imgur.com/LmWFGM7)

The first version was created with basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. This version was created using Sass (SCSS) and React and first published in late December, 2016. Although it started as part of my coursework at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/), I'm hoping to maintain it long after my time here.

One of my goals for this site was to create it 'from scratch' without the use of additional libraries. I did utilized some [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as well as [Devicons](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/#/main) and [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

Some of this site's features are...
 * Built with React
 * Responsive design using SCSS
 * Use of the GitHub API for profile photo and bio paragraph at the top.
 * Stylized GitHub Chart imported using the [GitHub Chart API](https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api) by @2016rshah.
 * All the images were taken and edited by me including the main background image which is a picture of the [Anna Maria Island City Pier](https://www.facebook.com/Anna-Maria-City-Pier-131516579663/) (a regular hangout for our family). Here is the [original photo](src/images/ami-city-pier.jpg) and the [edited photo](src/images/ami-city-pier-2.jpg) used for the main page.
 * I styled the button hover effects starting with a template by [David Conner on CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidicus/pen/emgQKJ?editors=0110).

Some things I would like to add in the future...
* Medium does not support importing latest blogposts through their API. I am trying to find a work-around for this. Until then I will continue to update the content manually.
