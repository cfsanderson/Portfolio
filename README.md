I started this site as part of my coursework at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/) in late December, 2016. It is a simple, 1 page React app that features a custom responsive design.  

###TODO Some things I would like to add in the future...
- [ ] Multiple components for content sections.
- [ ] update to cssnext
- [ ] add email contact form
- [ ] date function for footer
- [ ] move nav to lower right on mobile
- [ ] update projects
