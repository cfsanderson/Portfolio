# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. The first version was created with basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. This version was created using Sass (SCSS) and React and first published in late December, 2016. Although it started as part of my coursework at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/), I'm hoping to maintain it long after my time here.

One of my goals for this site was to use create it entirely 'from scratch' without the use of additional libraries. The main background image is a picture of the [Anna Maria Island City Pier](https://www.facebook.com/Anna-Maria-City-Pier-131516579663/) (a regular hangout for our family).
