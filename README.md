# [Portfolio](http://portfolio-2-0.cfsanderson.surge.sh/)

![](./src/images/portfolio-preview-01.gif)

I started this site as part of my coursework at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/) in late December, 2016. One of my goals for this site was to create it 'from scratch' without the use of additional libraries. I did utilize some [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as well as [Devicons](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/#/main) and [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

Some of this site's features are...
 * Built with React.
 * Custom "hand-rolled" responsive design (no bootstrap - not that bootstrap is bad).
 * I originally styled it with Brandon Grotesque fonts but use Google Fonts as a fallback.
 * FontAwesome icons.
 * Use of the GitHub API for profile photo and bio paragraph at the top.
 * Stylized GitHub Chart imported using the [GitHub Chart API](https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api) by @2016rshah.
 * All the images were taken and edited by me including the main background image which is a picture of the Anna Maria Island City Pier (a regular hangout for our family). Here is the [original photo](src/images/ami-city-pier.jpg) and the [edited photo](src/images/ami-city-pier-2.jpg) used for the main page.
 * I styled the button hover effects starting with a template by [David Conner on CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidicus/pen/emgQKJ?editors=0110).
 * The hover effect for the GitHub project gifs were adapted from [these examples by Mike Young](https://miketricking.github.io/dist/).

###TODO Some things I would like to add in the future...
- [] Medium does not support importing latest blogposts through their API. I am trying to find a work-around for this. Until then I will continue to update the content manually.
- [] Multiple components for content sections.
- [] update to cssnext
- [] add email contact form
